\begin{otherlanguage}{english}The bread of the angels
becomes the bread of mortals;
the bread of heaven
puts an end to prefigurations.
O wondrous thing!
the poor, the slave and the humble
feed on their Lord

Of you, threefold and
one God, we ask:
Come to visit us
as we worship you;
lead us on your paths
to where we want to go:
to the light in which you dwell.\end{otherlanguage}
