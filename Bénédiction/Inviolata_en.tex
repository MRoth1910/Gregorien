\begin{otherlanguage}{english}Inviolate, whole and chaste art thou, Mary:
Thou art the shining gate of heaven.
O kind mother, dearest to Christ,
receive our pious proclamations of praise.
To thee our devout hearts and mouths cry out:
may our souls and bodies be pure.
Through thy sweet sounding prayers
may thou grant us forgiveness forever.
O kindly one! O Queen! O Mary!
Thou alone didst remain inviolate.\end{otherlanguage}
