\begin{otherlanguage}{english}Loving Mother of the Redeemer, 
who remains the accessible Gateway of Heaven,
and Star of the Sea,
Give aid to a falling people 
that strives to rise;
O Thou who begot thy holy Creator,
while all nature marvelled,
Virgin before and after
receiving that ``Ave'' from the mouth of Gabriel,
have mercy on sinners.

O God, Who by the fruitful virginity of blessed Mary, hast given to the human race the rewards of eternal salvation: grant, we beseech Thee, that we may experience her intercession for us, through whom we deserved to receive the Author of life, our Lord Jesus Christ, thy Son. ℟. Amen.
