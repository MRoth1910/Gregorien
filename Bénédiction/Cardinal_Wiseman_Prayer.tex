\rubrique{All kneel; the Priest begins:}

O Blessed Virgin Mary, (\textit{all join}) Mother of God | and our most gentle Queen and Mother, | look down in mercy upon us all | who greatly hope and trust in thee. | By thee it was that Jesus | our Savior and our Hope | was given unto the world; | and He has given thee to us | that we might hope still more.

Plead for us, thy children, | whom thou didst receive and accept | at the foot of the Cross, | O sorrowful Mother. | Intercede for our separated brethren, | that with us, | in the one true fold, | they may be united to the supreme Shepherd, | the Vicar of thy Son.

Pray for us all, dear Mother | that by faith | fruitful in good works, | we may all deserve to see and praise God, | together with thee, | in our heavenly home. Amen.

\rubrique{Then follows Benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist, in the usual way.}\end{otherlanguage}
