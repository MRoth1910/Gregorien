\begin{otherlanguage}{english}I devoutly adore thee, hidden deity,
Who are truly hidden beneath these appearances.
My whole heart submits to Thee,
because in contemplating Thee, it is fully deficient.

Sight, touch, taste all fail in their judgment of thee,
But hearing suffices firmly to believe.
I believe all that the Son of God has spoken;
There is nothing truer than this word of Truth.

On the cross only the divinity was hidden,
But here the humanity is also hidden.
Yet believing and confessing both,
I ask for what the penitent thief asked.

I do not see wounds as Thomas did,
But I confess that Thou art my God.
Make me believe much more in Thee,
Hope in Thee, and love Thee.

O memorial of our Lord's death,
Living Bread that gives life to man,
Grant my soul to live on Thee,
And always to savor Thy sweetness.

Lord Jesus, Good Pelican,
clean me, the unclean, with Thy Blood,
One drop of which can heal
the entire world of all its sins.

Jesus, whom now I see hidden,
I ask Thee to fulfill what I so desire:
That the sight of Thy Face being unveiled
I may have the happiness of seeing Thy glory. Amen.
