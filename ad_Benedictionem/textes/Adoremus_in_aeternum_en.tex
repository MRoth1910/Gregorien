\begin{otherlanguage}{english}Let us adore for ever the most holy Sacrament.

O praise the Lord, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people. For his mercy is confirmed upon us: and the truth of the Lord remaineth for ever. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the Holy Spirit; As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be : world without end. Amen. Let us adore.\end{otherlanguage}
