\begin{otherlanguage}{english}℣. Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand.

℟. And upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.

Let us pray. O God, Shepherd and Ruler of all Thy faithful, look mercifully upon Thy servant  \textit{N.}, whom Thou hast chosen as shepherd to preside over Thy Church: grant him, we beseech Thee, that, by word and example, he may edify those over whom he hath charge, so that together with the flock committed to him, he may attain everlasting life. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
