\rubrique{From First Vespers of Christmas until the Purification.}

℣. After childbirth, O Virgin, thou didst remain inviolate.

℟. Intercede for us, O Mother of God.

Let us pray. O God, Who by the fruitful virginity of blessed Mary, hast given to the human race the rewards of eternal salvation: grant, we beseech Thee, that we may experience her intercession for us, through whom we deserved to receive the Author of life, our Lord Jesus Christ, thy Son. ℟. Amen.
