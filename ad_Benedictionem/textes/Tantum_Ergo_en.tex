%{\vulgata
\begin{otherlanguage}{english}Therefore so great a Sacrament
Let us fall down and worship,
and let the old law
give way to a new rite,
and let faith stand forward
to make good the defects of sense.

To the Father and the Son be praise and joy,
health, honour and virtue and blessing,
and to him proceeding from both
be equal praise.
Amen.

℣. Thou hast given them bread from heaven. (\textit{P.T.} Alleluia.)

℟. Having within it all sweetness. (\textit{P.T.} Alleluia.)

Let us pray.

O God, who in this wonderful Sacrament hast left us a memorial of Thy Passion: grant, we implore Thee, that we may so venerate the sacred mysteries of Thy Body and Blood, as always to be conscious of the fruit of Thy Redemption. Who livest and reignest forever and ever. ℟. Amen.\end{otherlanguage}
