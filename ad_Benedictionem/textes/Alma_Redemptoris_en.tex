\begin{otherlanguage}{english}\noindent Loving Mother of the Redeemer, 
who remains the accessible Gateway of Heaven,
and Star of the Sea,
Give aid to a falling people 
that strives to rise;
O Thou who begot thy holy Creator,
while all nature marvelled,
Virgin before and after
receiving that ``Ave'' from the mouth of Gabriel,
have mercy on sinners.

Pour forth we beseech Thee, O Lord, Thy grace into our hearts, that we to whom the Incarnation of Christ, Thy Son, was made known by the message of an Angel, may, by His Passion and Cross, be brought to the glory of His Resurrection. Through the same Christ our Lord. ℟. Amen.

Amen.
