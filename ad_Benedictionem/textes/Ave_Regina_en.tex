\begin{otherlanguage}{english}\noindent Hail, O Queen of Heaven.
Hail, O Lady of Angels
Hail! thou root, hail! thou gate
From whom unto the world a light has arisen:
Rejoice, O glorious Virgin,
Lovely beyond all others,
Farewell, o exceedingly beautiful maiden,
And pray for us to Christ.

\noindent \vv Allow me to praise thee, O sacred Virgin.

\noindent \rr Against thy enemies give me strength.

\noindent Let us pray. Grant unto us, O merciful God, a defense against our weakness, that we who remember the holy Mother of God, by the help of her intercession, may rise from our iniquities, through Christ our Lord. â„Ÿ. Amen.
