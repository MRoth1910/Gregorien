\begin{otherlanguage}{english}The bread of the angels
becomes the bread of mortals;
the bread of heaven
puts an end to prefigurations.
O wondrous thing!
The poor, the slave and the humble
feed on their Lord.

Of thee, threefold and
one God, we ask:
Come to visit us
as we worship thee;
lead us on your paths
to where we want to go:
to the light in which thou dost dwell.\end{otherlanguage}
