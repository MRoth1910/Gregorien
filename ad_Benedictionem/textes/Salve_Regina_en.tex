\begin{otherlanguage}{english}\noindent Hail holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, 
our life, our sweetness, and our hope. 
To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. 
To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping 
In this valley of tears. Turn then, most gracious Advocate, 
thine eyes of mercy toward us. 
And after this our exile show unto us 
the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.

\noindent \vv Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.

\noindent \rr \hspace{-0.02em}That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

\noindent Let us pray. O almighty, everlasting God, who by the cooperation of the Holy Spirit, didst prepare the body and soul of Mary, glorious Virgin and Mother, to become a worthy dwelling for Thy Son; grant that we who rejoice in her commemoration may, by her gracious intercession, be delivered from present evils and from everlasting death. Through the same Christ our Lord. â„Ÿ. Amen.
