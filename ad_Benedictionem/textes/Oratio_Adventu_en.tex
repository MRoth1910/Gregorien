\rubrique{In Advent.}

℣. The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary.

℟. And she conceived by the Holy Ghost.

Let us pray. 
O God, who, by the message of an Angel, didst will thy Word to take flesh in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary, grant that we thy suppliants, who believe her to be truly the Mother of God, may be helped by her intercession with thee. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen. \end{otherlanguage}
